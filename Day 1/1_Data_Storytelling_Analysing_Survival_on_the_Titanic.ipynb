        "    - **Title & Sex:** Being female ('Mrs', 'Miss') was the single most significant advantage. Our engineered `Title` feature captures this nuance better than `Sex` alone, also showing that young boys ('Master') had a much higher survival rate than adult men ('Mr').\n",
        "    - **Passenger Class:** There was a clear survival hierarchy: 1st > 2nd > 3rd class.\n",
        "    - **Age:** Children and infants had a higher survival rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Other Influential Factors:**\n",
        "    - **Family Size:** Traveling in a small family (2-4 members) increased survival chances, while traveling alone or in a very large family decreased them.\n",
        "    - **Fare/Cabin:** Having a cabin (and thus paying a higher fare) was strongly correlated with survival, acting as a proxy for wealth and passenger class.\n",
        "    - **Port of Embarkation:** Passengers from Cherbourg ('C') had a higher survival rate, possibly because a higher proportion of them were in 1st class.\n",
